#Playing the game
The idea is to get the player to the water before getting hit by a bug.

Reaching the water will result in the player getting a point. The player needs 5 points to win.

Getting hit by a bug will result in the player losing a life. The player has 5 lives.

The only commands allowed are up, down, left, and right on your keyboard. Doing so will move the player in that direction one square on the screen.

Once you have either won or lost the game a dialog will appear and allow you to restart the game.
